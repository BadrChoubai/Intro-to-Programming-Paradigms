# What are "Programming Paradigms"?

In short: How you write/organize your code.

## Object-Oriented

- Organize data and logic in objects (properties + methods)
- Organize code in logical entities. 

## Procedural 

- Write sequential series of execution steps/tasks.
- "Top to bottom" code execution.

## Functional

- Organize code in (pure) functions with clearly defined tasks.
- Pass data round via parameters.
